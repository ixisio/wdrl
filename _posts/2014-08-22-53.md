Hello again,<br>
<br>
after two weeks without a reading list (I was on holiday) I had to catch up throusands of tweets and read dozens of articles for you. Though filtered, this week’s issue is massively filled with good articles. I hope you enjoy this issue and can now enjoy your weekend! :)

### News

- [iOS8 now supports `onscroll` events finally](https://news.layervault.com/stories/30925-ios-8-safari-no-longer-disables-scroll-events) and allows parallax or dynamic navigations now.
- [Kirby CMS v2 beta 2 is out](http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-2-beta-2) and shows some pretty cool features. So if you’re a fan already, soon some cool stuff is coming (release of v2 is planned for September) and if not, give it a look…
- Firefox has [HTTP/2 enabled by default in Nightly](https://todesschaf.org/posts/2014/08/05/http2-draft-14-in-firefox.html) builds now, reflecting the latest specification.
- [Sass 3.4 has been released](http://blog.sass-lang.com/posts/221239-sass-34-is-released) which is pretty cool but also means for you that graceful imports won’t work out anymore out of the box. Also if you’re a Windows users you should wait a bit until a bugfix release is out. New are `selector functions`.
- Chromium engineers now seem to have decided that they [don’t want to support Pointer Events](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757#c64) and instead want to improve Touch Events. Main reasons were the lack of support in WebKit/Safari and the performance of Pointer Events. It’s highly expectable therefore that the existing integration of PE in Blink browsers will be removed.

### General

- We’re organizing [NightlyBuild.io](http://www.nightlybuild.io/), an evening conference in Cologne, Germany this year with speakers such as Aral Balkan, Ian Feather, Alice Bartlett, Nico Hagenburger and more. But because you’re great, we’re already sold out!
- [Build your development and code documentation using Markdown](https://medium.com/code-stories/building-markdown-based-developer-docs-87c0317c56f7). And as a bonus, use GitHub as your Markdown CMS.
- [Construct the web out of stackable containers](http://containerist.org/).

- Telerik shared a blog article [how to style your own file upload field](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/comprehensive-guide-styling-file-inputs/). This is only used as example so you might be able to style any input field with that technique afterwards. Pretty cool!

### Go beyond…
