Hey!<br>
<br>
Have you ever thought about [how your users really visit your website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2CbbBLVaPk)? But a much more controversial topic this week was [Mozilla announcing their statement on EME / DRM support](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/05/14/drm-and-the-challenge-of-serving-users/). Fortunately, there are [great articles you should read](http://leomca.github.io/2014/05/15/Mozilla-and-DRM.html) on that topic. Now, read on with more exciting news:

### News

- [Introducing the WebKit FTL JIT](https://www.webkit.org/blog/3362/introducing-the-webkit-ftl-jit/).
- Firefox Nightly (v32a) now exposes the available [`navigator.languages` as JavaScript object](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=889335) and has [new error page design](http://i.imgur.com/AO5EZT7.png).

### Design

- [On Desiging Expectations](http://azumbrunnen.me/blog/designing-expectations/)—a truthy and good article.

### Tools

- This grunt task strips all media queries from your style sheet for [IE8 so that you can write mobile first](https://github.com/jtangelder/grunt-stripmq).
- [Quill](http://quilljs.com/) is a nice looking richt text editor.

### Git / CLI

- [Trash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash) is a command line app for moving files and directories to the trash—a safer alternative to `rm`.

### HTML

- [Accessibility: The Missing Ingredient](http://alistapart.com/article/accessibility-the-missing-ingredient)
- Responsive Images Done Right: [A Guide To `<picture>` and `srcset`](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/14/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/).

### JavaScript

- Again an interesting open source library by facebook: [Jest, a framework for painless unit testing](http://facebook.github.io/jest/).
- Here’s how you can [use Jest + jQuery for testing a vanilla app](http://www.phpied.com/jest-jquery-testing-vanilla-app/).

### CSS

- [How to maintain more than one Sass version](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/when-and-how-to-support-multiple-versions-of-sass--cms-20935). Because compatibility can sometimes be tricky here.
- Read [how the Guardian keeps Sass code quality with scss-lint](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/may/13/improving-sass-code-quality-on-theguardiancom). It’s a great tool you should really use if you’re working in a team.
- [How to dynamically change text color based on a background color](http://thesassway.com/intermediate/dynamically-change-text-color-based-on-its-background-with-sass).
