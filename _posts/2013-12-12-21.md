Christmas is coming nearer and nearer but this doesn't stop us from learning, right? In fact, this is the time where most cool tutorials are written&mdash;it's advent calendar time.

### News

- Use the new [`@at-root`](https://github.com/nex3/sass/blob/master/doc-src/SASS_CHANGELOG.md#at-root) in Sass 3.3 to write nested but don't produce nested selectors. Cool for BEM / OOCSS selector naming style.
- Firefox: [VP9 Video Decoder](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=833023) has been implemented.
- Firefox: [Support for OS X Web Notifications](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=852648) has been implemented.
- The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) has been [redesigned and improved](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/12/the-mozilla-developer-network-has-a-new-face/).
- [The Noun Project now has an API](http://www.thenounproject.com/for-developers/) for their icons. But it's invite only right now and will need to be paid monthly.
- [Chrome Apps are now available for Mac OS X](http://chrome.blogspot.de/2013/12/a-new-breed-of-chrome-apps-now.html) users, too.

### Tools

- [Browser Sync](http://addyosmani.com/blog/browser-sync/) is a Grunt tool that synchronizes your webpage view on all your devices.
- Really useful for Mac users: A [list of WebDev Quick Look PlugIns](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins) by Sindre Sorhus.
- [Grunt is not weird and hard](http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/).
- If you use GruntJS you should read this article about a modular, [shared Grunt Configuration](http://thenittygritty.co/shared-grunt-configuration).
- This article has some useful [Command Line One-Liners](http://arturoherrero.com/2013/11/29/command-line-one-liners/) for you.
- [What if you could use Chrome DevTools with Firefox?](http://kenneth.io/blog/2013/12/09/what-if-you-could-use-chrome-devtools-with-firefox/), asks Kenneth Auchenberg and provides a cool demo of his newly founded project [remotedebug.org](http://remotedebug.org/).
- An introduction of [Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment](http://css-tricks.com/continuous-integration-continuous-deployment/).
- [Back up your Git repositories from a remote server](https://gist.github.com/tobiastom/6695787). A simple shell script by Tobias Tom.

### Design

- Why a [View Mode Approach to Responsive Web Design](https://medium.com/design-ux/914c7d3795fb) makes actually much sense.
- Guy Podjarny checked the [real world-wide adption of Responsive Webdesign](http://www.guypo.com/mobile/rwd-and-one-web-adoption-rates/) and shares some interesting results. Nearly half of all websites use a mobile-redirect, and even on desktop 27% redirect their users on first request.

### HTML

- [Why bother with Accessibility?](http://24ways.org/2013/why-bother-with-accessibility/)

### Performance Matters

- Surely WebP, JPEG-XR both are cool new image formats that can save you a lot of bytes. But [reading this article](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/browser-specific-image-formats/) you can see the problem of them: Handling the conversion to these formats is super complex and with varying (lossy) quality settings it's super hard to automate conversion. I hope tools like Photoshop implement a better way unifying the experience soon.
- Many of you wish for a detection of connection speed. [This thread](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-perf/2013Dec/0072.html) sums up greatly why it's not useful for most use-cases like Responsive Images. By the way, reading Mailing List Archives is much nicer with [MLReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webstandards-mailing-list/kapkofkiggcefopeamfcpkkgfjjhmamf).
- Steve Souders wrote [a wishlist for web performance tools and improvements](http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2013/browser-wishlist-2013/).

### CSS

- iOS has this dirty zooming behavior in some cases when a user focuses a form element. It's now clear how you can prevent that without JavaScript: [Set font-size to at least 16px](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201212/ios_webkit_browsers_and_auto-zooming_form_controls/).
- [Bulletproof E-Mail Buttons](http://buttons.cm/).
- [Bulletproof E-Mail Backgrounds](http://backgrounds.cm/).
- [We love Icon Fonts](http://weloveiconfonts.com/).

### JavaScript

- 24ways advent calender has a great article to introduce you to [Animating Vectors with SVG](http://24ways.org/2013/animating-vectors-with-svg/).
- Cody Lindley provides his [JavaScript Enlightment book for free](http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/).
- He also provides his [DOM Enlightment book for free](http://www.domenlightenment.com/). Isn’t he awesome?

### Be inspired by…

- Jeffrey Zeldman who encourages everyone here to [keep blogging in the free world](http://www.zeldman.com/2013/12/11/this-is-a-website/).
- Aral Balkan who created a parody of [reformgovernmentsurveillance.com](http://reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/) (which actually when you try to post on twitter [results in this](https://twitter.com/helloanselm/status/410341410328825857/photo/1). Kinda funny, right? ) and with a decent humour explains you [what's going on with Google, Apple, Facebook, and all the other social media companies](http://reformcorporatesurveillance.com/).

Ciao!<br>
