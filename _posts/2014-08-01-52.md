Hey,<br>
<br>
a sunny friday, 1st of August, and as you receive this, my vacation has already begun. Therefore there won’t be an WDRL for the next two weeks regularly. It might happen that there’ll come one roundup mail in those two weeks but as I’m mostly in the mountains my access to the Internet will be not much. So enjoy this list, and if you’re bored and don’t know what to do: [Go to the archive and read through](http://wdrl.info/archive/)… there’ll be plenty stuff you already forgot which might be helpful for you. Have a good time, see you in two weeks!
