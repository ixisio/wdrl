Welkom!<br><br>
just another week passed and it's time for the next issue of the Web Development Reading List. Thanks to your support the list grew massively which is awesome!

As this project is growing, I switched the website code to use Jekyll. All archives from now on are written in Markdown language and are [available on the archive page](http://wdrl.info/archive/).
The bigger news is, **there is now an [RSS feed for the WDRL](http://wdrl.info/feed.xml)** as many of you wished.
Also you are now able to **submit links for the next issue via the [Submission-Page](http://wdrl.info/submit/)**. This is limited to 100 entries per month, so if the form is disabled, please be patient and submit later.
