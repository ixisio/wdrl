Hey,<br>
<br>
this week I learned a lot about code refactoring and about super advanced Grunt workflows. After trying to fix some existing code for hours I decided to rewrite the whole component. After half an hour I was finished and it was performing much better.<br>
Second, it’s simply amazing what our front-end tools like Grunt (or Gulp) can help us with our workflow. The web is definitely moving forward as you can see every single week in this letter and I am proud to be part of this process. Let’s make the web even better&mdash;if you’re in Germany in May, join me on the [WebPlatformDocSprint and a Barbecue](http://lanyrd.com/2014/wpds-dusseldorf/).

### News

- [Firefox (29) supports live editing of Sass and Less](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/live-editing-sass-and-less-in-the-firefox-developer-tools/) in the DevTools using source maps (You need Sass v3.3 pre to do that or Less 1.5+). Saving of the edits is also possible.

### General useful things

- Remove unnecessary whitespace before you commit files with [`git-stripspace`](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-stripspace). You can even set a prehook to do this ahead of every commit.
- Don’t get git yet but wanna get starting? Here’s [Git, the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

### Design

- [Type Quest](http://typequest.org/) shows you beautiful opentype features.
- [Mobile navigation icons A/B tested](http://exisweb.net/mobile-menu-abtest) with interesting results. Be careful what you use!

### Tools

- [Font Prep](http://fontprep.com/) is the missing Font Generator for Mac OS X to convert fonts to web-fonts.
- [RecordIt!](http://recordit.co/) records your screen so you can share short animated gifs of your screen. Useful for blog articles and tutorials.
- [`screenshot-service`](https://github.com/FWeinb/screenshot-service) – a WebKit based screenshot service tool.
- Do you want to know more about Grunt and a solid tooling workflow for your projects? Here is my article [“Kick-Start your Project with INIT and Grunt”](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2014/02/20/kickstart-your-project-with-init-and-grunt/) on Smashing Magazine.
- [Supercharge and simplify your Gruntfile](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/tooling/supercharging-your-gruntfile/) by splitting into one partial for each task.

### SVG

- Everything is relative, adaptive and should be responsive. [The art of the adaptive image](http://w3.eleqtriq.com/2014/02/everything-is-relative-the-art-of-the-adaptive-image/) shows how to create a multi-layered SVG. Supercool!
- Never understood the tutorials and articles about animating SVGs? [Chris Coyier shares how he learned it](http://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/). And it’s a really simple tutorial!

### JavaScript

- This article compares [Promises, Generators and other approaches to manage callbacks in node.js](http://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-callback-hell-promises-generators/).

### CSS

- A good overview on [combining CSS Selectors](http://galjot.si/combining-css-selectors).
- [Bower all the things](http://anotheruiguy.roughdraft.io/8927018). How to use to manage your front-end dependencies.
- [10 good scss utilities](http://hackingui.com/front-end/10-best-scss-utilities/) that help you build your website project.
- The new [CSS `font-synthesis`](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-synthesis-prop) will let you define if a browser should emulate a bold font weight or italic font style if the font doesn’t provide it itself. This can avoid the ugly faux bold font renderings.

### Go beyond…

- [The Web is the platform or the perils of esoteric setups](http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2014/01/13/the-web-is-the-platform-or-the-perils-of-esoteric-setups/). Doug Belshaw about the difference and importance of the web and how it can drive whole operating systems.
- You like sketching? Moleskines are your daily compagnion? Then have a look at [Baron Fig](http://www.baronfig.com/)—The Book for Ideas which looks pretty nice.
