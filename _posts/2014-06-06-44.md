Hey,<br>
<br>
an exhausting week for me finally comes to an end. The usual work ongoing, I am in the last preparations for my conference in Berlin, Germany, called [PUBKON](http://2014.pubkon.eu/) happening next week. But we’re here for the latest news and coolest articles of the week.<br> Before that, thanks for all the people who support me on [GitTip](https://www.gittip.com/Anselm%20Hannemann/) and [Flattr](https://flattr.com/profile/helloanselm), you’re amazing! And now on to the articles I want to share with you:

### News

- [Picturefill 2.1-beta](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/releases/tag/2.1.0-beta) contains several bugfixes, vastly improved `srcset` parser and a more robust test suite.
- With iOS8 UIWebView (the App internal web browser) will [finally get the same performance](http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/03/ios-8-webkit-changes-finally-allow-all-apps-to-have-the-same-performance-as-safari/) as the iOS Safari. This is a huge step for web based apps or for 3rd party browsers like Google Chrome.
- Gmail is experimenting with a [browser plugin to provide end-to-end encryption for emails](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.de/2014/06/making-end-to-end-encryption-easier-to.html) for its users.
- [LibSass 2.0](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/releases/tag/v2.0) has been released this week and brings support for “BEM”-selectors, `.sass` language support, string functions, UTF-8 support and fixes a ton of errors.
- [Web Animations 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-web-animations-20140605/) Specification has been published by the W3C.
- [CSS Modal is out in version 1.1](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/releases/tag/v1.1.0), but seriously it’s more a 2.0.

### General stuff

- Fing a [collection of important WebDev Front-end feeds](https://github.com/impressivewebs/frontend-feeds) here.

### Design

- Don’t forget to [give realistic feedback for mouse events](http://bfred.it/notes/2014/give-realistic-ui-feedback-on-active/) like the `:active` state on buttons.

### Tools

- [Helium-CSS](https://github.com/geuis/helium-css) finds unused CSS rules.

### Security

- Mike West has an interesting [specification in the works for Mixed Content](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/mixedcontent/) that describes how and why user agents disallow rendering and execution of content loaded over unencrypted or unauthenticated connections in the context of an encrypted and authenticated document.

### Web Performance

- Chrome now supports a [`stale-while-revalidate` header from servers](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/06/01/chrome_and_stale-while-revalidate) to indicate how often a resource should be revalidated. It is similar to the `max-age` header but a bit more granular and acts as extenstion of it.
- See [how Twitter deals with WebFont performance](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24026876/why-are-css-inlined-base64-encoded-webfonts-rendered-with-a-delay) and why you sometimes will see a FOUT on your user page. A very interesting insight and approach.

### HTML

- [Get started with Responsive Images and test them](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/testing-responsive-images/), or read [how to use Responsive Images article](http://nostrongbeliefs.com/responsive-images/), .

### JavaScript

- A good tutorial by Addy Osmani about [Mutation Observers](http://addyosmani.com/blog/mutation-observers/), when and how to use them.
- What `(function (window, document, undefined) {})(window, document);` [really means](http://toddmotto.com/what-function-window-document-undefined-iife-really-means/).
- [JSNice](http://jsnice.org/) is an online tool that de-obfuscates and nicifies your JavaScript.
- [Snap.js](https://github.com/jakiestfu/Snap.js) is a library for creating beautiful mobile shelfs in Javascript.
- The [Feuilles Editor](http://feuilles.github.io/Editor/) is open source, it’s similar to the one from Editorially and you should definitely check it out.
- [Best practices for better RESTful APIs](http://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2014/06/05/10-best-practices-for-better-restful-api/).

### CSS / Sass

- You’re mathematically fit? Well, here’s a little piece by Ana Tudor about [inverse trigonometric functions with Sass](http://thesassway.com/advanced/inverse-trigonometric-functions-with-sass).
- CSS: [Should we change the default for `overflow`](http://bocoup.com/weblog/new-overflow-default/)?
- Why [encapsulation of modules and the Single Responsibility approach](http://drewbarontini.com/articles/single-responsibility/) makes sense.
- Chris Coyier [shares his all-time favorite demos](http://davidwalsh.name/chris-coyiers-favorite-pens) on CodePen.

### Go beyond…

- If we want to make tech companies safe places for those struggling with mental health issues, [I believe it is essential that our leads, managers and C-level executives become certified in Mental Health First Aid](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-June-6#).
