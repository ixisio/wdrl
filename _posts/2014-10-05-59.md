Hey,<br>
<br>
I’m a bit late this week with the reading list but so much stuff has taken my time in the past days. Enjoy reading this week’s articles and consider [supporting me to cover the costs of the weekly resource you love](https://gratipay.com/Anselm%20Hannemann/):

### News

- Big news: [Internet Explorer now has a uservoice page](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-internet-explorer-platform/filters/top) where you as a user can vote for features to be supported by IE.
- Microsoft also announced [Windows 10 technical preview and its new IE](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/10/01/internet-explorer-and-the-windows-10-technical-preview.aspx) featuring HTTP/2, better JS performance and some more little improvements.
- You wonder why Windows 10 instead of 9? Well, some thoughts which might indeed be true, say because of OS sniffing. Here’s the [appropriate search on GitHub](https://searchcode.com/?q=if%28version%2Cstartswith%28%22windows+9%22%29).
- Cloudflare recently made big news by announcing [*free* universal SSL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/) for everyone on their platform. Yes, even free plans get it. This is a huge step and I hope others step up and will also offer this for free by default.
- [Ericsson has open sourced their experimental Bowser browser](https://gigaom.com/2014/10/02/ericsson-open-sources-openwebrtc-to-provide-alternative-to-googles-webrtc-implementation/) and released it for iOS bringing WebRTC to the platform.

### General

- [Some further thoughts on privacy](http://petergasston.co.uk/further-thoughts-on-privacy/) is a good read why we struggle with Privacy advisors and their zero tolerance strategy.
- The previous link is sharead because this experiment came to my attention: [How much of your data would you trade for a free cookie?](http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/how_much_of_your_data_would_you_trade_for_a_free_cookie_20141001) You might guess, it’s ridiculously much private information people traded for just as much as one free cookie!
- Oh man, [the indie web movement is so important](http://dangillmor.com/2014/04/25/indie-web-important/)! If you just care a bit about it, [see if you can join border:none 2014](https://border-none.net/2014) in a few weeks.

### Design

- A good reminder how important it is to have a [good balance of line length](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/29/balancing-line-length-font-size-responsive-web-design/) in responsive web designs.
- Mike Monteiro’s second book [“You’re my favorite client”](http://www.abookapart.com/products/youre-my-favorite-client) can now be purchased and sounds very promising.
- If you [use video backgrounds on a website, be sure to follow these guidelines](http://www.punkchip.com/accessible-html-video-as-a-background/).
- If you’re interested in hand crafted arts and design and live in the UK you should give [Whosit&Whatsit](https://whositandwhatsit.com/) a visit and [support their crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/whosit-whatsit-retail-for-independent-design).

### Tools

- See [what Remy Sharp discovered using Firefox DevTools](https://github.com/remy/remysharp.com/blob/master/public/drafts/firefox-devtools.md) instead of Chrome’s for just one week.
- Firefox DevTools now display pseudo elements (`:after`) in the DOM. [Yay!](https://twitter.com/dane_macmillan/status/517308962883260416/photo/1)
- There’s a new alternative to Adobe’s Photoshop and Illustrator tools on OS X: [Affinity Designer](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/Affinity_Designer/id824171161?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)
- Use [Font Family Reunion](http://fontfamily.io/) to see compatibility tables for default local fonts.
- Learn from Paul Irish how to do [advanced debugging with the Chrome DevTools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17HjGp4pQlNh2WIwKiTcUpDLIuOdkUcRmALFuoytQsjU/preview#slide=id.p).
- [Drag Gradients](http://elrumordelaluz.github.io/draGGradients/) is a great webapp that lets you create advanced gradients via Drag and Drop.
- Advice of the day: [Don't `rm` yourself](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/how-not-to-rm-yourself.md).

### Git

- Learn [how to rewrite history in Git](http://blog.thoughtram.io/posts/going-back-in-time-to-split-older-commits/). It’s super powerful and needs much caution and care as you could delete important things but sometimes it’s very helpful.

### Web Performance

- Ian Feather’s talk at NightlyBuild 2014 about [“Establishing Performance Contexts”](http://www.slideshare.net/ianfeather/performance-contextsslideshare-39618574)
- [To Picturefill, or not to Picturefill](http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/to-picturefill.html)… that is the question. And Scott Jehl gives an answer here in his article.
- By the way, here’s an article sharing how a [responsive images implementation](http://writings.orangegnome.com/writes/implementing-responsive-images-in-a-production-environment/) could look like also from a backend view.
- Lastly, Jason Grigsby shares his insights on [Image Resizing Services](http://blog.cloudfour.com/image-resizing-services/).
- Do you have questions on HTTP/2? Here’s the [FAQ page](https://http2.github.io/faq/) that helps you out.

### JavaScript

- [5 Array Methods That You Should Be Using Now](http://colintoh.com/blog/5-array-methods-that-you-should-use-today). Good read to update your JavaScript knowledge.
- Sindre Sorhus has built an [Atom plugin that automatically fixes your JSHint warnings](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-fixmyjs) using fixmyjs.
- Zach Leatherman at Opera Dev on a [Better `@font-face` with Font Load Events](https://dev.opera.com/articles/better-font-face/).
- [Exploring JavaScript Closures](http://blog.binarymist.net/2014/05/31/javascript-closures/)

### Sass / CSS

- Whoop whoop! [Libsass 3.0-rc1 is out](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.0rc1) with massive improvements, new features (yes `@extend`!) and more spec matching than ever before. Along with that, the founders and core developers of Sass announced feature parity and a unified roadmap for rubysass and libsass. Exciting days ahead!
- More news on Sass from the SassConf 2014 can be seen [in this massive roundup](http://unakravets.tumblr.com/post/98971370655/sassconf-2014-resource-roundup).

### Go beyond…

- Why your [Passion](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/dan-donald/2014-October-2) is the most important thing to keep things running and why you should hold it even when things don’t go as expected.
- Aaron Mentele shares in [The Crow and the Cave Dweller](https://medium.com/@aaronmentele/the-crow-and-the-cave-dweller-b230cc750694) his insights how the web industry works and how to find your personal place of interest between agencies and other freelancers.
- [Your code will and must change over time](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/raquel-velez/2014-October-4).
