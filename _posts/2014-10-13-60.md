Hey,<br>
<br>
last Friday you might already have wondered why no WDRL has been delivered to your inbox. That is because I received some feedback on the sending day and now once wanted to try sending it on Monday. **I’d like to know your preferred day, please just reply to this email with the preferred day**. Of course, if you want to give me more feedback feel free to add it, too. I don’t do automatic precesses here, it’s my personal project and I read every mail individually.

Apart from my past week, [CSS had its 20th birthday last Friday](https://dev.opera.com/articles/css-twenty-years-hakon/) and it’s great to see how CSS was founded, evolved and after twenty years is still on a great way. Now, a lot happened in the past days so I won’t bother you anymore and let you read the whole story below now:

### News

- The beloved [Kirby CMS version 2.0](http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-2) is here. It has nice new features, a nice editing panel, and many more cool things!
- [Firefox now has WOFF2.0 support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1064737) in Nightly build.
- Adobe released [new stuff for Creative Cloud members](http://www.creativebloq.com/adobe/adobe-releases-20-big-updates-creative-cloud-101413139) including Kuler as standalone app, Photoshop Sketch, Lightroom mobile, Brush and many more new apps. Daniel Mall already played with it and [has some tricks to share](http://danielmall.com/articles/creative-cloud-libraries/) about CC libraries.
- GitHub now gives you a dashboard to [view your issues and pull requests](https://github.com/blog/1901-managing-issues-and-pull-requests-across-repositories) across all repositories and organizations. And they now also [show differences between SVG revisions visually](https://github.com/blog/1902-svg-viewing-diffing).

### General

- Do you really think Opera Mini doesn’t count? Well, [here are some numbers](http://www.operasoftware.com/blog/smw/state-mobile-web-report-indonesia-focus) again to re-consider.
- [“Move fast, break nothing”](http://zachholman.com/talk/move-fast-break-nothing/). Zach Holman shares his thoughts in a talk and says you sometimes don’t have the option to fail and need to not break anything.

### Tools

- [Ind.ie Pulse](https://ind.ie/pulse/) is the first product of Aral Balkan’s team to decentralize the web and it is a sync tool for your files to replace proprietary software like Dropbox.
- Wow, an [online image editor called “polarr”](https://www.polarr.co/editor) that is super performant and has most features you need.
- [Katon](http://dailyjs.com/2014/09/23/katon/) is a development server manager for your local machine.
- [gulp-cssurl](https://github.com/alexandref93/gulp-cssurl) lets you systematically replace URLs in your CSS code. This is the Gulp tasks to [CSSUrl](https://github.com/nzakas/cssurl).
- Using [githooks](https://github.com/gtramontina/ghooks) can be useful for your development work and can easily assure quality when commiting code. I’ve used in in projects and it’s very good.
- A [grunt task to extend your images with your responsive images presets](https://github.com/smaxtastic/grunt-responsive-images-extender). A very cool plugin that adds `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to your images following your configuration. Interesting if you can generalize your sizes and styles to match a default set.

### Web Performance

- [Perfmap](https://github.com/zeman/perfmap) is a bookmarklet to create a front-end performance heatmap of resources loaded in the browser using the Resource Timing API.
- With Blink engineers removing Pointer Events in favor of Touch Events, [this research text by Jacob Rossi](https://plus.google.com/u/0/wm/4/+JacobRossiGT/posts/VLDTsgYzw9b) is interesting which is the same for [Alex Sexton’s statement on the whole discussion](https://gist.github.com/SlexAxton/f1c7c03512fd66ae20ce).
- How to [serve WebFonts on a site much faster](http://bdadam.com/blog/loading-webfonts-with-high-performance.html) with no service and localStorage.

### HTML / SVG

- An inevitably good [class on semantics and class naming in HTML and CSS](http://slides.com/heydon/getting-nowhere-with-css-best-practices#/42) bearing Accessbility in mind.

### JavaScript

- A highlevel wrapper for PhantomJS: [Nightmare.js](http://www.nightmarejs.org/).
- [Replace standard `alert()` dialogs with something beautiful](http://tristanedwards.me/sweetalert).
- Learn [how to use the Beacon API](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2014/10/Send-beacon-data-in-Chrome-39) and send asynchronous requests as fast as possible without interfering with the navigation of the page. Already works in Chrome 39.
- Do you use a tool like JSHint? Well, then you might also want to automatically fix issues that appear in your code? [FixMyJS](http://addyosmani.com/blog/fixmyjs/).

### Sass / CSS

- Afteer LibSass 3.0rc3 has been announced, [here is the roadmap for LibSass](https://github.com/sass/libsass/wiki/The-LibSass-Compatibility-Plan) in which feature parity is announced for LibSass 3.4!
- Need some fresh approach on tooltips? This [Codrops article by Mary Lou gets you covered](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/10/07/tooltip-styles-inspiration/).

### Go beyond…

- [Under-promise and over-deliver](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/scott-jehl/2014-October-9).
