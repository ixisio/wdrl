Hi,<br>
<br>
a week passed by and quite a few things happened since then. Mozilla kicked some hot things, some cool new (and some older but yet unknown) tool arrived. Web performance is a big thing this week and there’s a lot to catch up on this topic in this reading list. Web Components definitely will be a big topic in 2014 so the two articles will prepare you for that, some JavaScript insights, and a few CSS and Sass tricks conclude this wrap up list. But as always, I've got some inspirational articles on the very bottom of each issue. Happy reading! :)

### News

- Firefox is [implementing the latest spec of Custom Elements](http://soledadpenades.com/2014/02/28/firefox-now-implementing-the-latest-custom-element-spec/), part of Web Components.

- Wonder where Mozilla invests his money in? For example they developed a [new JPEG encoder called `mozjpeg`](https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/03/05/introducing-the-mozjpeg-project/) that saves 10% of filesize in average and is fully backwards-compatible.

### Tools

### Web Performance

- Paul Lewis shows [his performance audit workflow](http://aerotwist.com/blog/my-performance-audit-workflow/).
- [CSS Selector Performance revisited](http://benfrain.com/css-performance-revisited-selectors-bloat-expensive-styles/): It’s much more important to clean your CSS from unused selectors than caring about which selectors you use.
- [“Don’t believe ‘Performance tricks’ posts”](http://cubiq.org/performance-tricks-for-mobile-web-development) says this post being one of them. They’re useful but it fully depends on your environment and you can only be sure about it if you test on your own.
- Mozilla provides you quite a few [insights into its memory management through the console](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/54/). This is an article showing you what you could use to find issues with your web application.
- If you use Gulp or Grunt, this Yeoman article shows you [some packages to optimize performance](http://yeoman.io/blog/performance-optimization.html).

### JavaScript

### CSS / Scss

- An [alphabetical list of all CSS properties](http://ref.openweb.io/CSS/). How many of them do you know and use?
- [Grid Style Sheets](http://gridstylesheets.org/) is a grid system that provides you with the most common approaches like element centering so you don’t have to care about it anymore.
- Organizing and structuring your scss files is super important. That’s why you should follow some conventions and here is an example [how to order your properties and sub-selectors](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/sass_packing). I follow the same rules since quite some time and it works great! Similar to that, here are some [Sass rules](http://www.mikestreety.co.uk/blog/sass-rule-layout) by Mike Street.

- [Your Website needs to tell a story—here’s why](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/your-website-needs-tell-story-heres-why-21410811)…
