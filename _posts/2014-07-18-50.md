Hey,<br>
<br>
wow, itâ€™s already the 50ths edition of Web Development Reading List (WDRL) and itâ€™s been over a year now since I started this project. With summer outside and this party fact ðŸŽ‰ enjoy the list now, spread the word and if you like the issue, support it (see details below). Thanks for subscribing, have a great weekend!

### News

- [iTerm 2 version 2.0](http://www.iterm2.com/news.html) is out. The popular terminal replacement app for OS X users has been released this week and now integrates tmux integration, toolbelts, triggers and new preference settings.
- The Guardian published its [developer website](http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog) with a great blog about what theyâ€™re developing.
- In Firefox DevTools, disabling Cache is now a persistent setting and will apply next time you use the DevTools, too. Also, Firefox now got a patch to support `noreferrer`-attribute on links.
- Google Chrome Canary supports the
[`<dialog>` element](http://codepen.io/Wilto/pen/hevFs) now.

### General stuff

- Back in CSS Level 2 a bunch of [system colors](http://www.iangraham.org/books/xhtml1/appd/update-23feb2000.html) have been defined. This is pretty cool as a user can set those colors in the OS and have it applied to your website.

### Design

- Google published [Noto](http://www.google.com/get/noto/#/), a font harmonized visually across all languages (and supporting them all).


### Tools

- [`jit-grunt`](https://github.com/shootaroo/jit-grunt) is a neat grunt plugin that loads your pugins just in time instead of loading all into the memory without needing them all in that moment. It massively speeds up small grunt tasks but doesnâ€™t work well for huge deployment tasks. Use it, but do it wisely.
- [Why Bower is the right package manager](http://frontendbabel.info/articles/bower-why-frontend-package-manager/) for Front-Ends.
- If youâ€™re annoyed by the online services for placeholder images [this tool creating SVG base64-encoded placeholders](http://schepers.cc/svg/svg-datauri-img.html) might be for you.

### Git

- Martin Wolf shows how to [push your git repository to more than one remote](http://martinwolf.org/2014/07/14/pushing-to-multiple-git-repositories-simultaneously/).

### JavaScript

- When you build a JavaScript plugin itâ€™s easy to [support AMD and CommonJS in a go](http://ifandelse.com/its-not-hard-making-your-library-support-amd-and-commonjs/).
- [Hongkong](https://github.com/drublic/hongkong) is a super-lightweight jQuery plugin for creating parallax effects.
- [OpenType.js](http://nodebox.github.io/opentype.js/) is an OpenType and TrueType font parser. It allows you to access the letterforms of text from the browser or node.js.

### HTML / SVG

- Finally you can read this in-depth article by Sara Soueidan to understand the [SVG Coordinate Systems & Transformations](http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-coordinate-systems/) by starting with the `viewport`, `viewBox`, & `preserveAspectRatio` attributes.

### Sass / CSS

- How you can [calculate your CSS animations with CSS](http://hugogiraudel.com/2014/07/16/automating-css-animations-with-sass/) and automate it with Scss. A cool technique Iâ€™ve been using myself several times now (although not putting that effort into a proper Sass mixin like Hugo did here).
- [CSS only styled Custom select boxes](http://jsbin.com/batoli).
- Jake Bresnehan, author of Web Design Weekly, wrote a great guide [how to deal with a large CSS codebase](http://web-design-weekly.com/2014/07/17/dealing-with-a-large-css-codebase/) in a project. Keeping them simple, conventions, a good toolchain and testing is most importantâ€¦
- Harry Roberts shares advice to keep specifity low and shows some hacky tricks for [dealing with specifity issues in CSS](http://csswizardry.com/2014/07/hacks-for-dealing-with-specificity/).
- Introducing [SassDoc](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc), like JSDoc but for Scss code.

### Go beyondâ€¦
