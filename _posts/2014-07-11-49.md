Hey,<br>
<br>
another week, another list of articles for you to read over the weekend. Enjoy the list, spread the word and if you like the issue, support it (see details below). Thanks for subscribing, have a great weekend!

### News

- [Opera 24 (Dev-Channel)](http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2014/07/opera-developer-24-changes-tab-preview-html5-h-264-video-support/) adds h264 support, tab preview.

### General stuff

- **[Behold the Fold](http://cognition.happycog.com/article/behold-the-fold).** Sophie from HappyCog shares her thoughts on “above the fold” and how impossible it is to figure out how wide and tall it is if you build your website responsively and without sneaking into the browser resolution, preventing it from prefetching things and only delivering the content with JS.
- Bastian Allgeier about [Simplicity](http://bastianallgeier.com/notes/simplicity) and Tooling in today’s web industry.

### Design

- After all, from a customer service perspective, [“meeting our users wherever they are”](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/scott-jehl/2014-july-7) may be more “on-brand” than anything a style guide can hope to suggest.
- [Source Sans Pro](http://blog.typekit.com/2014/07/09/source-sans-v2/) is available in version 2.0 now with lots of improvements and new features (Cyrillic, Greek, IPA support).

### Tools

- Wow, Paul Lewis documents the [path a browser goes](http://aerotwist.com/blog/pixels-are-expensive/) from your markup and styles to display a pixel to the user.
- [Huxley](https://github.com/facebook/huxley) is Facebook’s visual regression testing tool. But be aware that it uses Selenium WebDriver.

### JavaScript

- [Five practical Examples for learning how React Framework works](http://tutorialzine.com/2014/07/5-practical-examples-for-learning-facebooks-react-framework/).
- [Isomorphic JavaScript](http://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2014/06/27/isomorphic-javascript-script-build-awesome-webapps-with-the-best-of-two-worlds/)—or why meteor.js and Rendr are very different to Backbone or Angular.

### HTML / SVG

- A lot of browser bugs related to webfonts can be found [in this CodePen collection](http://codepen.io/collection/ijEJq/).
- Tim Evko about [‘Front End Security is a thing, and you should be concerned about it’](http://web-design-weekly.com/2014/07/09/front-end-security-thing-concerned/).
- Speaking of security, did you know it’s possible to [track your identity using CSP](http://words.zemn.me/csp) (Content Security Policy)? This is when security generates insecurity…

### CSS

- Sara Soueidan published another good article in which she explains how to [clip elements and paths in CSS and SVG](http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-svg-clipping/).
- CSS Colorguard parses your CSS for color values and compares them. If it the finds very similar colors, it throws a warning and advises you to merge these sligthly different colors into one. It’s configurable as you want (threshold) and uses an [amazing algorithm for the comparison](https://github.com/markusn/color-diff).
- [The Future of Media Queries](http://www.slideshare.net/yiibu/the-future-of-mediaqueries) in which we get information about scripting support, luminosity, pointer information, hover possibility, content update-frequency (think of eInk displays, paper) and a proposal how to solve these approaches another way.
- It’s an amazing piece of code what Osvaldas Valutis has built here but also sad that we still need to [deal with so much hazzle in 2014 to get Responsive Equal Height Blocks](http://osvaldas.info/responsive-equal-height-blocks).
- [Build Spheres with CSS](https://medium.com/css-tutorials/css-spheres-aab1a341deb2) shows what is possible nowadays: Build a spinning world just in CSS.

### Go beyond…

- [What I’m most scared of, though, is being left behind…](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-July-6)
