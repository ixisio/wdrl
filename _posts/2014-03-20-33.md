Hi,<br>
<br>
this week I will cover you with latest browser news, many Sass articles and some thoughts to enhance your life and work. Happy reading!

### News

- [Firefox 28 is out as stable build](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/28) and that means, Firefox now supports multi-line flexbox finally as the last browser, gets `background-blend-mode`, `window.screenX | window.screenY` return CSS pixels instead of device pixels now, VP9 video decoder support, removed support for SPDY/2 and a lot more.
- [Firefox 29](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/29), the next release, upcoming for everyone in April 2014, will bring us improved network panel in DevTools, CSS sourcemaps support and autocompletion of CSS properties. CSS Variables can be enabled behind flags, `box-sizing` is unprefixed, `will-animate` property , `touch-action` (both behind flags), and `<input type="color">` and `number` are supported.
- Yet proprietary it’s still good to see [CSS being the styling language even in Operating Systems](http://dev.bowdenweb.com/css/pseudo/ms-trident-vendor-prefixed-pseudo-elements.html).

### General stuff

- [How to introduce your client to a more agile workflow](http://8gramgorilla.com/why-clients-should-be-more-agile/)  for your project.
- [Trying out TLS encryption for `HTTP://` URLs](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/03/17/trying_out_tls_for_http_urls). On opportunistic encryption in the HTTP protocol. It doesn’t replace HTTPS but is a good default for all sites.

### Tools

- A [free email validation service](http://blog.mailgun.com/post/free-email-validation-api-for-web-forms/) by Mailgun (part of Rackspace) for you to use.
- [Stylestats](https://github.com/t32k/stylestats) is a node.js library to to collect statistics from your CSS files. There is also a grunt-task for it.

### HTML

- A QA interview with some people of the Responsive Images Community Group [about `<picture>`, `srcset` and all the other stuff going around](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/picture-element-qa/). (Probably) All you ever wanted to know about Responsive Images answered in one short article…

### JavaScript

- Doing fancy stuff on scroll in the browser window is fancy but [when you scrolljack you are taking the memory](https://medium.com/design-idea/7764db6a9987) of how a customer’s (most of you call these people users) legs work.

### CSS / Scss

- [A Sort function in Sass](http://thesassway.com/advanced/implementing-bubble-sort-with-sass) by Hugo Giraudel.
- [How to break out of `overflow: hidden`](http://css-tricks.com/popping-hidden-overflow/) (I did warn you: it’s an obscure solution).
- [Explore Sass Maps](http://www.phase2technology.com/blog/exploring-maps-in-sass-3-3/), a feature of 3.3 covering arrays. Maps can even contain sub-maps or any other type of data.
- [Efficient CSS Transforms and Animations explained](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2014/03/18/css-animations-and-transitions-performance/).
- [Drop shadows for 2 coherent elements](http://helloanselm.com/2014/drop-shadows-for-two-coherent-elements-preserving-intersection-in-css/) while preserving the intersection in CSS. A little trick for you, by me.

### Go beyond…

- “8 hours of work, nothing done“—[my journey into interruptions](https://medium.com/on-coding/459d1842400), getting wired in, and being able to write more than a couple of lines of code a day…
- This blog post is called “[My advice to young developers and designers](http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2014/03/my_advice_to_young_designers_and_develop/)” but I think it’s good for everyone to read…
- Sometimes you need to [stop to move forwards](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/relly-annett-baker/2014-March-19#)…
