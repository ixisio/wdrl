Hey,<br>
<br>
today is [border:none](https://border-none.net/) time which I’m very excited about. This WDRL is served again on Friday. Last week I asked if you prefer Monday over Friday and, in fact, I got a ton of replies but funny enough it’s like 50% want it on Friday, 50% on Monday. At the moment I’m not yet sure what to make of it but I’ll think of a good solution. Unfortunately I can’t personalize the email sending date (which I’d love to but as far as I know even paid systems don’t offer this feature).
If the date WDRL is delivered to you isn’t ideal for you personally, please mark it unread, flag it or store it as you like and read it when you have time for it later.

Now, have a great weekend and fun with this edition of the latest web development links. And [I’m grateful about any donation that keeps this letter and my motivation alive](https://gratipay.com/Anselm%20Hannemann/).

### General

- [Dou you Webview?](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2014/10/09/do-u-webview/) asks Steve Souders and shows how important it is as users mostly visit your website on mobile through a webview.

### Design

- It’s absolutely essential to [treat front-end development as part of the design process](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/primed-and-ready-to-go/). However, the (foolish, artificial) line between design and development “phases” gets in the way of true collaboration between disciplines. An interesting article on project structures and collaboration.

### Tools

- [Embed files from a github repository](http://gist-it.appspot.com/) like a gist.
- Getting started with and [understand the power of Vim](http://robertnyman.com/2014/10/16/getting-started-with-understanding-the-power-of-vim/).

### Sass / CSS

- Doh, what a clever technique by Krasimir Tsonev: [CSS only solution for UI tracking](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/16/css-only-solution-for-ui-tracking/).

### Go beyond…

- Why we fail and why [whilst we have more knowledge than ever we still can’t apply it properly](http://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2013/11/why-we-fail/).
- Chris Eppstein, co-creator of Sass, has some important words for us: [“What’s the meaning of life? Loving others.”](https://twitter.com/chriseppstein/status/522537828685606912) I find this very important in times where so much hate and anger is shown to other people.
