Hey,<br>
<br>
a big day for me: Today [NightlyBuild.io](http://www.nightlybuild.io/) is kicking off with a stellar line-up of speakers and attendees and I am part of it. But you’re not here to read mine but web development’s latest news. So once again I gathered links, articles over the past week and reduced it to the most interesting ones. Here is WDRL 58:

### News

- [`npm@2.0.0` is out](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/98131109725/npm-2-0-0). It will allow you to pass arguments into scripts and simply reflects some breaking change to the codebase. From now on, npm will stick more closely to semver so expect more major versions in the future. But of course many more features have been introduced, bugs fixed.
- Ha, iOS8 is out and you might want to add a new icon size to your mind. Because from now on, 180px is the size you want to provide as asset. [See more in this thread over at html5boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/pull/1599).

### Tools

- Adobe just [open sourced their font type development tools](http://blog.typekit.com/2014/09/19/new-from-adobe-type-open-sourced-font-development-tools/). This is a pretty cool announcement and I’m very excited to see this.
- Ionic lets you [spin up a livereload testing server for multi device testing right from any Pen](http://blog.codepen.io/2014/09/17/ionic/) over at CodePen.
- [walkmod](http://www.walkmod.com/) is an open source tool for coding conventions.

### Git

- If you use Github and have a few repositories over there you might struggle having an overview on the issues and milestones across your repositories. This tool by the people of Hoodie is [a dashboard to manage your repositories](https://github.com/espy/ubersicht).
- [GitHub Linker](https://github.com/stefanbuck/github-linker) is a Chrome extension that links dependencies in a package or bower file to their GitHub page.

### Web Performance

- Paul Lewis about [Layout Performance](https://speakerdeck.com/paullewis/edge-layout-performance-panel-intro).

### HTML / SVG

- Oh my god, someone said it: [“Don’t use `<picture>`”](http://blog.cloudfour.com/dont-use-picture-most-of-the-time/). No, of course it’s not that easy and that is what Jason Grigsby is explaining. But most of the time you probably want to use `srcset` and `sizes` not `<picture>`.

### JavaScript

- You might have seen them a few times but didn’t understand why the value had prefixed `!!`  or what `||` between two values means? [This article explains the most common JavaScript hacks](http://blog.mdnbar.com/javascript-common-tricks).

### Sass / CSS

- If you use Foundation as framework, you might be interested in this [Foundation 5 Cheat Sheet](http://sudheerdev.github.io/Foundation5CheatSheet/).
- [On `:target`](http://css-tricks.com/on-target/) and what you can and should use it for.
- Using `img { max-height: 100vmin; }` on your page to never again have a photo stretch beyond the viewport in height. By [Oliver Joseph Ash](https://twitter.com/OliverJAsh/status/514130279720812545)

### Go beyond…

- [‘Free’ is the curse of the Internet](http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/staff-editorials/10338/free-internet-curse/). “Here’s a little thought experiment: Consider everything you do online. How much of it do you pay for directly?” (…)
- [What goes around comes around.](http://blog.offscreenmag.com/post/97956574961/what-goes-around-comes-around) Some fanastic, thoughtful lines by Kai Brach, creator of the Offscreen Magazine.
- Speaking about valuation and money, here’s [another company that is now transparent with their salaries](http://blog.giantswarm.io/transparent-salaries-its-not-for-breaking-workspace-taboos) and they do it for a reason.
- It’s often not easy to decide what to choose. But often [we make our decisions harder than they should be](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/steph-troeth/2014-September-21) by having too many choices. Great read by Steph Troeth.
- [Not knowing means you’re dependent on someone else](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/marie-connelly/2014-september-24). We need each other but weirdly though that’s sometimes hard to accept.
- If you’re near Germany, you might want to go to [border:none](https://border-none.net/2014), the Creator Conference for The Rising Web.
- But if you’re in United Kingdom instead, you might want to go to [theWeb.is](http://www.theweb.is/).

Thanks and all the best,<br>
