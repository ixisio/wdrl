Hey,<br>
<br>
this week was special to me. Thanks to you and all other supporters, I have been nominated as Young Developer of the Year (and also with my side-project OpenDeviceLab.com) for 2014s netawards and had the honor to join the ceremony this Friday in London. Unfortunately I didn’t win but it was a great day meeting all the lovely people there.

This week I found a couple of interesting things like writing Selenium tests in NodeJS, got a bunch of news like Jekyll 2.0, and lastly some inspiring articles.
