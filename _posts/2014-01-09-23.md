Welcome back!<br>
<br>
I hope all of you had a great Christmas holiday and a good start into the new year 2014. Since January, 5th, I moved from Munich to Cologne (still Germany) for around six months to work on a new project. For me this is a great change in the new year and I have many more things I want to do in 2014. [Be inspired by this list](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/jay-fanelli/2013-december-31) to change things.
