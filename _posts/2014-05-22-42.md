Hey,<br>
<br>
what an inspiring week. I’ve been at the Beyond Tellerrand conference and a few side-events and met many lovely people, saw [great talks](http://2014.beyondtellerrand.com/schedule) and whilst that, the internet didn’t stood still. But first, a warm welcome to all new subscribers (and hell, it has been a lot—so many, that I reached TinyLetter subscriber limit. But the lovely staff fixed that very quick)! This week, I have a lot of browser news for you, a new open source font, designing for motion, best practices for JavaScript and, of course, some inspiration at the end. Have fun!

- [Fixing Layout Thrashing in the real world](http://mattandre.ws/2014/05/really-fixing-layout-thrashing/).

### Go beyond…

- [The fine line between Hero and Zero](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/greg-hoy/2014-May-17#). It’s easy to say you’ll do better if you’re not in the same situation but when you are, try your best to stick to your statement. Leading companies is a tough job if you want to do it good.
