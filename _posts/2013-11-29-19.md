Hey,<br>
<br>
it's (Black) Friday and it's already time again for another Reading List. I hope all of you who celebrated Thanksgiving had a great and enjoyable time yesterday.

- Aral Balkan announced [IndiePhone](http://indiephone.eu/) today, part of his indie web campaign.

### Web Performance

- [A practical guide to web resource caching](https://blogs.akamai.com/2013/11/part-2-a-practical-guide-to-web-resource-caching.html)
- The [Top 5 Performance improvements list](http://www.guypo.com/mobile/top-5-tips-for-making-fast-rwd-sites/) by Guy Podjarny.
- Steve Souders on ["Performance and Custom Elements"](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2013/11/26/performance-and-custom-elements/)

### HTML

- Responsive Images are it again: Kornel Lesinski has put an alternative, improved [`<picture>` specification](http://geekhood.net/picture-element.html) into [the race](http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2013-November/041641.html). This is a likely to be implemented proposal.
- [WCAG is discussing changes to <img>](http://blog.adrianroselli.com/2013/11/image-alt-exception-change-re-re-re.html) for what we considered for <picture> element and its accessibility.
- While we're at accessibility: Karl Groves tested [alternative texts on img elements](http://karlgroves-sandbox.com/image-alt-tests.html). The results are (unfortunately) not as one would expect.

### CSS

- With Chrome 32 you will be able to use CSS `object-fit`. Still, a lot of browsers are not supported. Here is a plain JS [object-fit-polyfill](https://github.com/anselmh/object-fit) that enables the method down to IE8. Also, I wrote a [little post on that](http://helloanselm.com/2013/fix-image-resizing-with-object-fit/).
- Understand [how Sass @extend works](https://gist.github.com/nex3/7609394).
- Enable [60fps scrolling with pointer events](http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/pointer-events-60fps). It's kind of hacky but shows that Pointer Events are just great!
- [Modernizr has now a `:target` selector test](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/commit/91dbab79207aa8c63489383f115c9475eb3edf38).

### JavaScript

- Do you know and use the `strict` mode? If not [read the explanation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode).
- If you don't want to have AMD code in your production code anymore, you can [clean it with this tool](http://gregfranko.com/amdclean/).
- [Life of JavaScript](http://lifeofjs.com/) is the source for all types of awesome resources available for JavaScript. This includes books, presentations, videos, feeds, sites, libraries, frameworks and tools.
- [RegExplained](http://leaverou.github.io/regexplained/) by Lea Verou is a great tool to live-visualize regular expression patterns.
- [eq.js](https://github.com/snugug/eq.js) enables you to use element queries.
- [waitress.js](https://github.com/Zinssmeister/waitress.js) is a lean JS library (it's actually not really more a function) that makes waiting on a collection of async calls less painful.
- If you use Brackets as code editor you might be interested in [Theseus](https://github.com/adobe-research/theseus), a pretty darn cool JavaScript debugger.

### Be inspired by…

- Colin Nederkoorn who transitioned its company from a [normal bureau to a remote office](http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Remote-teams.html) and wrote about it. Surely this is not the right way for everybody but maybe it inspires you.
- Leo Babauta who gives you an advice how to [Find Focus](http://zenhabits.net/finding-focus/) again.
- Jordan Moore (Yes, 2nd link to him in this list!) who shares his [design principles](http://www.jordanm.co.uk/post/68410595788/my-design-principles) which all of you designers should follow.
- Oli Studholme who gives you advice [how to get your dream job](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/oli-studholme/2013-november-29/).
