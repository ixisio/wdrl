### Web Performance

- [Reaching Everyone, Fast.](https://speakerdeck.com/tkadlec/reaching-everyone-fast-at-velocity-ny-2014)

### HTML / SVG

- Sara Soueidan’s talk from CSSConfEU about [SVG Animations and Styling](http://slides.com/sarasoueidan/styling-animating-svgs-with-css?token=jCcrBSyuS6CmMQsd8Aof3TpxyZQr#/).

### JavaScript

- [The fundamental disconnect](http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/2014/a-fundamental-disconnect/). Aaron Gustafson on why web languages work how they work, why it’s not comparable to other programming languages and why the illusion to have control is wrong.

### Sass / CSS

- [All you need to know about vertical aligns](http://christopheraue.net/2014/03/05/vertical-align/). Half a year old but still so valuable.
- Usually people stick to ordering CSS properties from A-Z, by type, by length. But how about the [“Outside in”](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/outside-in-ordering-css-properties-by-importance--cms-21685) approach?
- [Cross-browser CSS for consistent `<select>` field styling](https://github.com/filamentgroup/select-css).

- [Why it’s so important to go to conferences](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/wayne-thume/2014-September-14) or similar events.

By the way, here’s a guide [how to choose the right web conference](http://keirwhitaker.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-web-conference-thats-right-for-you/).
