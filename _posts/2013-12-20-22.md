Hey,<br>
<br>
I'm writing this week’s reading list the last time for this year already. It has been amazing how fast this project evolved and how supportive my readers like you are&mdash;big hugs to everyone out there supporting me. It all keeps me up writing this list nearly each week now.<br>
Therefore I wish you a merry christmas, calm winter holidays and a happy new year!


### News

- [Google now chaches all images included in an email](http://gmailblog.blogspot.de/2013/12/images-now-showing.html). With that tracking will be impossible.
- [Firefox 29 will support CSS Variables](http://mcc.id.au/blog/2013/12/variables).
- Firefox also has done [massive work in their DevTools again](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/12/split-console-pretty-print-minified-js-and-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-28/): App Manager, Web Console, Debugger, tooltips.
- [Chrome on Android has no 300ms delay](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away) on button press anymore.
- The [Jasmine](http://pivotallabs.com/jasmine-2-release/) framework got five this week and with that the team just [released version 2](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) of it!
- Friends should help friends to get amazing jobs. Now [there’s a platform](http://hiremyfriend.io/) for that.

### Tools

- [DevTools Terminal](http://blog.dfilimonov.com/2013/09/12/devtools-terminal.html) might be a useful Chrome Extension to use a terminal in your DevTools. But don't be disappointed, it’s a bit limited.
- Raymond Camden wrote a Brackets extension which directly gives you [hints on browser compatibility while you're writing code](http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/12/16/New-Brackets-Extension--Canalyzer).
- The guys from Information Architects who built IA Writer three years ago, just released [Writer Pro](http://writer.pro/). It’s the bigger and evolved version of IA Writer and from what I know and could see, it’s worth every penny if you write a lot of texts.
-

### Design

- [SVG Generation](http://www.svgeneration.com/) provides you cool backgrounds and serves them customized by you (colors, etc) as SVG or base64.
- You know this meetings when the first 30 minutes are searching for files, emails etc.? Solve this by [providing Project Hubs](http://24ways.org/2013/project-hubs/). And there’s also a [template](https://github.com/bradfrost/project-timeline) by Brad Frost.

### Performance Matters

- A [performance comparison between client-side and server-side rendering](http://blog.mwaysolutions.com/2013/11/08/client-vs-serverside-rendering-the-big-battle-2/) for markup including BackboneJS and AngularJS.
- [Don’t optimize JavaScript](http://gu.illau.me/posts/dont-optimise-javascript/) and find the real culprit because JavaScript is rarely the cause of slow applications&mdash;you know, “Optimising JavaScript is not about the syntax”.

### CSS

- [Multi-line padded text](http://css-tricks.com/multi-line-padded-text/) with very clever tricks.
- Ever fully understood `z-index`? [Here’s a guide](http://dev.tutsplus.com/articles/what-you-may-not-know-about-the-z-index-property--webdesign-16892) to fix that.
- Although `z-index` can do much, it’s not enough for web-apps and different views. [Here are thoughts how to solve that](http://aerotwist.com/blog/the-web-needs-containment/).
- Cool stuff will be available with [CSS Selectors Level 4](http://www.script-tutorials.com/css4-selectors-level-4/) &mdash; this is a roundup.
- [The (probably not) definitive list of CSS features in non-CSS specs](http://generatedcontent.org/post/69819716803/css-outside-css).
- [Create a great mobile navigation](http://css-tricks.com/line-menu-icon-menu/) that works from the ground up on all screen sizes and has a nice fallback for old browsers.
- Last but not least, Jeremy Keith wrote a piece of text about [Sasstraction](http://adactio.com/journal/6606/) in which he says “CSS isn’t voodoo, it’s a simple and straightforward language where you declare an element has a style and it happens.”. Keep that in mind.

### New Year Resolution Proposals

- …[Think by Making](https://vimeo.com/82173290).
- …Help to [Decentralize](http://decentralize.it/) the Web and make it great again!

I whish you Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

All the best,<br>
Anselm
