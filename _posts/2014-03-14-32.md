Hi,<br>
<br>
this week [the Web turned 25](http://www.webat25.org/). It has been an amazing journey from what I can say and I want to thank everyone out there who actively helped to push the web forward, to develop web standards, browsers, and all the things so I can work in this great area of Front-End development. Thank you all! &hearts;

### News

- [Sass 3.3 is out](http://blog.sass-lang.com/posts/184094-sass-33-is-released). With big news like Source Maps support (Wooo!), SassScript Maps, easier inheritance operators (`&-suffix`), changed variable scope it’s a big release and a huge step forward for Scss as a language.
- [Grunt 0.4.3 is out](http://gruntjs.com/blog/2014-03-07-grunt-0.4.3-released). It is a bugfix release and deprecates the `grunt.util.*` API.
- [Bower 1.3](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) is out, featuring many small improvements and allowing circular dependencies to be installed as well as scripts/hooks support.
- Chrome now has an [intent to ship CSS `touch-action`](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/sc5lHnlcLvM) to control touch actions via CSS.
- [Chrome will support WOFF2.0 in version 35](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/j27Ou4RtvQI/qWUHf-332jgJ) to improve the load and (de)-compression behavior of webfonts along with some other webfont improvements so that they’re loaded faster.
- [What’s new in iOS 7.1 Safari](http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/ios-7-1-safari-minimal-ui-bugs)—in short, mostly bugfixes but some bugs still left behind. And please, oh please, `minimal-ui` is for Homescreen-Apps only—don’t even think of using it on a normal website.

### Design / UX

- [Why rounded corners are easier on the eyes](http://uxmovement.com/thinking/why-rounded-corners-are-easier-on-the-eyes/), so [how do rounded corners affect accessibility](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/11150/how-do-rounded-corners-affect-usability)?

### Git

- [Git tips and tricks Part 1](http://hugogiraudel.com/2014/03/10/git-tips-and-tricks-part-1/).
- [Rebase you interactively for great good](http://phuu.net/2014/02/24/rebase-you-interactively-for-great-good.html).
- [Git Subtrees as alternative to Git Submodules?](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/05/alternatives-to-git-submodule-git-subtree/)

### Tools

- Joschi Kuphal just published it’s [Iconizr tool now made in node](https://github.com/jkphl/node-iconizr). This means there’s now also a grunt-task [`grunt-iconizr`](https://github.com/jkphl/grunt-iconizr). Iconizr takes a folder of SVG images and creates a CSS icon kit out of them, serving the icons as SVG / PNG sprite or embedded data URIs (depending on the client's capabilities), along with suitable CSS / Sass / LESS etc. resources and a JavaScript loader for easy integration into your HTML documents. Very useful!
- [Tiff creates a visual comparison between two typefaces](https://tiff.herokuapp.com/).
- [Stylestats](https://github.com/t32k/stylestats), an efficient node library for keeping stylesheet statistics.

### Web Performance

- How to track down performance issues on your own site when you don’t know where to start. And about [Improving fixed positioned elements performance](http://benfrain.com/improving-css-performance-fixed-position-elements/). And last but not least, why a Retina MacBook Pro behaves differently than a non-retina regarding painting cycles.

### HTML

- [Some practical ARIA examples](http://heydonworks.com/practical_aria_examples/). I really wished to have had this document a long time ago already…
- Here’s a [Web Components Custom Element Boilerplate](https://github.com/webcomponents/element-boilerplate) (if you’re using Polymer).

### JavaScript

- [Learn regular expressions in 55 minutes](http://qntm.org/files/re/re.html).
- [5 JavaScript debugging tips you’ll start using today](http://berzniz.com/post/78260747646/5-javascript-debugging-tips-youll-start-using-today).
- [Beyond Source Maps](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/55/)—why source maps in JavaScript aren’t enough and what needs to be done to make them great.

### CSS / Scss

- There is now [a new CSS Regions polyfill](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2014/03/10/css-regions-polyfill-better-smarter-fuller/) which works better, smarter and fuller. Great to see this after Blink dropped native support a few weeks ago.
- [Getting started with Sass Source Maps](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/b4daab987fb0).
- How to find out what went wrong and where to search when a Sass build fails: [An introduction to Error handling in Sass](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-error-handling-in-sass--cms-19996).
- Nicolas Gallagher on writing a [Custom Preprosessor](http://nicolasgallagher.com/custom-css-preprocessing/) in Node that extends systems like Sass.

### Events

- The [Decentralize Camp](http://decentralizecamp.com/), part of “Marc’s Web Week” in Dusseldorf (Germany) in May looks great. Tickets are EUR 25, Jeremy Keith and some great people who invent decentralized solutions will speak there. If you can, join it.
- The amazing [FromTheFront](http://2014.fromthefront.it/) will be back in September 2014 in Bologna (Italy). A super nice city, nice people and a great conference for a small budget.
- [TheWeb.is](http://www.theweb.is/) will be a large conference with so many great speakers on board. Ping me if you’re there so we can meet!

### Go beyond…

- [Frank Chimero on being ‘lazy’ and/or just being a monkey with pants](http://frankchimero.com/blog/this-ones-for-me/), about life, and the balance between living and working.
- [Criticism: we're all in this together](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/d-keith-robinson/2014-March-9#).
- Over time, I find [that I ask for advice less](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/lorna-mitchell/2014-March-8#) and less. It’s not that I don’t need the input of other people any more; rather that I know whose advice I would ask, and I know those people well.
