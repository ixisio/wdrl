Hey,<br>
<br>
it’s been quite a busy week for me but I managed to find _at least some_ time to read and collect some articles for you. Thanks for the ongoing support and the growing list of subscribers to this weeklyish summary!


### News

- [Chrome 33](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/01/chrome-33-beta-custom-elements-web.html) introduces custom elements (part of [Web Components](http://jonrimmer.github.io/are-we-componentized-yet/)), which is pretty cool, unprefixed pageVisibility API, drastically improved web font downloading.
- Bootstrap now has an [official Sass port](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).
- Firefox [DevTools News](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/01/upcoming-changes-to-the-firefox-developer-tools-node-picker/): Node Picker gets new position and other improvements. Unfortunately there’s no mention to support calling it with a keyboard shortcut as it’s possible in Chrome (cmd + Shift + C).

### General useful links

- [The Front-end Choice Paralysis](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/addy-osmani/2014-January-19).
- [The Guardian has all front-end code on GitHub](http://guardian.github.io/developers/projects/). A great resource to look at.

### Tools

- Did you know that you could [pass through parameters to PhantomJS](http://jonathan-jackson.net/cli-phantomjs-options-through-poltergeist)? For example you can disable loading images to prevent Timeouts.
- [Testardo](https://github.com/WebReflection/testardo) is a browser and OS agnostic web driver for mobile and desktop.

### Web Performance

- [SiteSpeed.io](http://www.sitespeed.io/) is an open source tool that helps you analyze your website speed and performance based on performance best practices and metrics.
- Trello sped up their board loading time in one week. And [they documented what they did and what they achieved](http://blog.fogcreek.com/we-spent-a-week-making-trello-boards-load-extremely-fast-heres-how-we-did-it/) in a small diary.
- Building a responsive website is not that easy anymore, especially if you want to have responsive images. Therefore be careful when building or choosing a JavaScript that handles this case for you. Mathew Marquis wrote [about the challenges with respimg-script and pitfalls](http://filamentgroup.com/lab/respimg_scripts/).
- WebKit Nightly now has a resource level timeline and a per-call site timeline in its Inspector. Very good for a performance analysis!   ![Screenshot of the Network inspector showing the rendering timeline](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BenNy73CMAAajdL.png)

### JavaScript

- Groupon published their testing framework [Testium](https://engineering.groupon.com/2014/misc/i-tier-testium/).

### CSS / Sass

- [A modern scale for web typography](http://typecast.com/blog/a-more-modern-scale-for-web-typography) which proposes you good scaling values for Desktop, Tablet and Smartphone font-sizes.
- [Sass Animation Studio](https://github.com/Team-Sass/animation-studio) by Rachel Nabors is a hell of a tool to create CSS based animations. Very useful!

- If you're a Sublime Text user, you probably wanna [give Sublime CSS Completions a try](https://github.com/daneden/sublime-css-completions).

### Go beyond.

- I love conferences and I hope you, too? If so, here is [a guide where you could go in the next few months](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/22/upcoming-web-design-events-jan-2014-jun-2014/).
