<p>Yo!<br><br>
I didn't expect my list to grow so well over the first four weeks so I am a little bit overwhelmed by the response from you. Thank you so much for your support – keep it coming and share the love to my tiny newsletter with your friends.</p>

<p>Last week not much happened – that way I turned into the announced 'regular' every other week mode. Well, I'd say it really depends how much happened in the web industry. If there is much to tell, I keep you posted, if there's nothing or not enough to tell, you won't get a message. In that case, enjoy the sunny days (I hope it is as here) and relax a little bit.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It is <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thisisnpr/2013/07/18/203014226/small-screen-big-stories-npr-comes-to-google-glass">Responsive Webdesign when it works everywhere</a> – even on Google Glass! A little but nice article about Glass optimization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://minifiedjs.com/">MinifiedJS</a> claims to be a library only 4kb big with the full power of jQuery and browser support. This sounds great, maybe you should give it a try in your next project?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Jamie Mason created a <a href="http://jamiemason.github.io/ImageOptim-CLI/">comparison table on image optimization</a> tools and its results. Quite interesting numbers and results you should have a look at.</li>
	<li><a href="http://bower.io/">Bower 1.0</a> is out.</li>
	<li>IE11 will get many new features in its DevTools. The <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/ie11-developer-tools/">preview looks pretty neat</a> and there will be quite some really cool features.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/shama/grunt-hub">GruntHub</a> lets you manage several grunt.js projects in parallel. This is cool!</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/blai/grunt-express">Grunt Express</a> lets you start an Express server including LiveReload etc. all in one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Luke wrote a summary to <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1747">Page Speed is only the beginning</a>.</li>
	<li>Chris Coyier <a href="http://css-tricks.com/does-flexbox-have-a-performance-problem/">researched flexbox for a performance lack</a>. Fortunately Paul Irish jumped in with some <a href="http://css-tricks.com/does-flexbox-have-a-performance-problem/#comment-490956">interesting feedback</a>.</li>
	<li>Oh man, did you know that <a href="http://www.mobify.com/blog/data-uris-are-slow-on-mobile/">using Data-URIs on mobile</a> could slow down your page massively? Better re-think this workflow. Guesses are that it's the base64 encoding which would make pretty much sense. Anyway, consider using files / sprites again to speed up your site on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Other</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Well, you know about the inconsistencies of CSS implementations in the different browsers, right? Here's another: <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/bg-size">background-size</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the best and rock on!<br>
