<p>Servus mitanand [Hi guys],<br><br>
damn it, this message should have gone live since five days now as we're already counting the 10th official issue of Web Development Reading List. With over already over 400 subscribers I am so happy how this project evolved. But while in my home city Munich the Oktoberfest began, I am chilling in Italy enjoying the last bits of summer sun. Happy reading!</p>
