Hey,<br>
<br>
what a week, heh? If you’re a sysadmin I hope you got at least some sleep in the past days. OpenSSL contained a serious bug which was leaked on tuesday, right when the official support for Windows XP (and therefore IE <=8) ended. But also as a user you need to be strong now—and [you’ll likely need to reset **all** your passwords everywhere soon](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/heartbleed/). But first you need to manually check [if the site has already fixed the bug](https://github.com/tobiastom/heartbleed) before you change your password. If not, you need to avoid the site until they fixed the security leak.<br>
However, I catched up with the internet once again and collected a series of links for you all around front-end development:

### News
