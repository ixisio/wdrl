Hi,<br>
<br>
at this time I hope you have not much longer to work before you have some short holiday break for easter. Exciting times are ahead and I have found some great articles again for your this week. From Scss Unit testing over more design / UX related stuff to Touch Events and finally about getting better at receiving critical feedback. Happy easter!

If you happen to be around Europe in May, I’d love to meet you at the [Web Platform Doc Sprint in Düsseldorf](http://lanyrd.com/2014/wpds-dusseldorf/) right before beyondtellerrand conference takes place. I grant you it’ll be a great meeting where you can learn how to write docs for webstandards, meet cool people and have some delicious handmade burgers and drinks afterwards paid by Adobe. Come and join! :)

### News

- [Chrome Beta now offers more control over touch and zoom actions](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/04/chrome-35-beta-more-developer-control.html), supports Promises, `Object.observe`, and unprefixed Shadow DOM. Also CSS Font-loading and SVG paint-order and unprefixed Audio API are included in Chrome 35 beta. Video Fullscreen API does not work prefixed anymore and `webkitRequestAnimationFrame`, too.

### General stuff

- After FiveSimpleSteps having been acquired by Monotype, [the new homes of the books can be found here](http://andycroll.com/2014/04/13/the-new-homes-of-five-simple-steps-books/).

### Design

- Frank Chimero’s transcript of his talk [“Desigining in the borderland”](http://frankchimero.com/talks/designing-in-the-borderlands/transcript/). Read it because it’s a great piece of content, or at least, because the article’s so beautifully designed itself.

### JavaScript

- This SmashingMag article explains about [ConditionerJS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/04/03/frizz-free-javascript-with-conditionerjs-2/) and the origins of it. It evaluates conditions like media queries, element queries, or pointer mode and can load assets / scripts depending on it.
- [Image Lightbox](http://osvaldas.info/image-lightbox-responsive-touch-friendly), responsive and touch friendly. Simplicity and ease of use. And it’s just for images, nothing else.
- [Build a map infographic](http://googledevelopers.blogspot.de/2014/04/build-map-infographic-with-google-maps.html) with Google Maps and JavaScript.

Laucke trying to figure out [how touch and pointer events work in detail](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2014/04/javascript-touchpointer-events-research-notes-screenreaders-faked-mouse-events-touchscreens/) in each browser and a research on the accessibility of them.

### CSS

- The CSSWG just published a new working draft for the [CSS Line Grid Module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-line-grid-1/). It provides features to align content to a baseline grid with the CSS [`line-grid`](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-line-grid-1/#line-grid), `line-snap`, `line-slack` and other properties.

- Val Head’s [“The CSS Animations Pocket Guide”](http://valhead.com/book/) is available here and should be purchased via Pay what you like. (But you could get it also for free).
- [The Power of the `em` unit](http://www.sitepoint.com/power-em-units-css/) in CSS. Often neglected, replaced with `rem` but it’s also supercool to [Size Web Components](https://medium.com/front-end-development/8f433689736f).
- [Work typographically correct in CSS](http://elliotjaystocks.com/blog/justification-hyphenation/), for example  with hyphens and justification.

### Sass

- About libsass and ruby-sass—discussing if [libsass is ready for primetime yet?](http://benfrain.com/libsass-lightning-fast-sass-compiler-ready-prime-time/) because it can be up to 41x faster.
- [How to do unit tests for your Scss](http://mts.io/2014/04/02/sass-unit-testing/)—yes, you heard right! And there is [Bootcamp](http://thejameskyle.com/bootcamp/) which is very similar to Jasmine, and [True](https://github.com/ericam/true) as frameworks.
- Prepare [Sass extends to be usable within media queries](http://www.sitepoint.com/cross-media-query-extend-sass/). Because you just need to work around a little bit. Nice technique!

### Go beyond…

- [Get better at accepting critical feedback on your work](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/wren-lanier/2014-April-14#)…
- How to get better only by [developers talking with designers](http://erskinedesign.com/blog/future-of-web-design-2014/) and vice versa. Also, how to influence other people doing “just” your Front-End work.
