Hey,<br>
<br>
what a week! Preparing a conference takes a lot of time, especially in the last days. But when the event is running, you’re totally excited and rewarded for your amount of work. This is the reason why the letter this week has been a bit delayed, as my conference, the PUBKON, took place the past days.

But now I want to give you the newest links and articles of the past week. I’d really appreciate to reach my goal on [gratipay](https://www.gratipay.com/Anselm%20Hannemann/) solely set for my open source stuff and this newsletter or [flattr](https://flattr.com/profile/helloanselm) me. To know more how I curate this list, [this short text](http://wdrl.info/about/#donations) will tell you more.

### News

- [Docker 1.0 has been released](http://blog.docker.com/2014/06/its-here-docker-1-0/).
- Get some updates for the [Browser Platform Status](http://platformstatustracker.azurewebsites.net/) over here. Unfortunately it is missing other browsers than Chromium and some info about IE.
- [Gulp 3.8](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#380) has now more flexible options for source and destination.
- `srcset` is supported in Firefox Nightlies behind flags now, and [you can test it here](http://codepen.io/RICG/pen/poKfj).
- Adobe [fixed the viewport unit issues](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2014/06/12/improving-viewport-unit-support-in-webkit/) (`vw`, `vh`) in WebKit.

### General stuff

- The web idealists have a point: [Content can't truly blossom in walled gardens](http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/russell_davies/article/1298102/the-web-idealists-point-content-cant-truly-blossom-walled-gardens/).
- Yeah! [Snake](http://codepen.io/jackrugile/pen/IHbvh/) in CSS and JavaScript as CodePen Demo by Jack Rugile.

### Tools

- The [Gulp + Browserify Starter Guide](http://viget.com/extend/gulp-browserify-starter-faq). Don’t worry, Grunt and RequireJS are still as cool but if you’re not liking the Grunt infrastructure there’s a good chance you might like Gulp’s.
- [Laverna](https://laverna.cc/) is an open source (beta) tool similar to Evernote but with end-to-end encryption, sync, Markdown support, Tasks, and no required registration.
- The [Remote Debugging Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging) by Google has been updated with latest techniques and tools.

### HTML

- How to [approach Multi-Color Fonts](http://www.pixelambacht.nl/2014/multicolor-fonts/) in browsers? The different possibilities by browser vendors written up.
- A web component to display your [GitHub Card](http://pazguille.github.io/github-card/).
- Another web component gives you the possibility to [use and trigger Web Notifications](https://github.com/1000ch/x-notification).
- [Adding Captions to HTML5 Videos](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manipulating_media/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video).

### JavaScript

- This little spec appearing in a future WHATWG document is the [`fetch` specification proposal](http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method) and might make requests so much easier than you’re used to with XHR at the moment.
- A little bit about [encapsulated markup](http://css-tricks.com/using-encapsulation-semantic-markup/) by using the Shadow DOM.
- How to [Force a repaint of an element with JavaScript](http://martinwolf.org/2014/06/10/force-repaint-of-an-element-with-javascript/). Shown in a nasty hack but gives you an insight when a browser does a repaint. Be careful with setting show / hide styles in JavaScript.
- If you want to display a video as full page background, [this little jQuery plugin](https://github.com/stefanerickson/covervid) might help you here.
- jQuery offers a lot when you include the whole library. If you only need parts of it, in jQuery 2.x you can also [use the specific AMD modules](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/jquery-using-only-what-you-need/) of it separately and save a lot of bytes this way.

### CSS

- Sara Soueidan wrote an awesome [article about the upcoming `will-change` property in CSS](http://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/) for Dev.Opera. Very important if you transform elements on your page with CSS or JavaScript.
- Tab Atkins’ slides about [the Future of Layout with CSS](http://www.xanthir.com/talks/2014-06-04/).
- Stoked by [CSS Filters](http://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects/#FilterProperty)? Here’s [Schepp’s polyfill](https://github.com/Schepp/CSS-Filters-Polyfill).
- This list by Ethan Malasky about [CSS Shapes and CSS Compositing & Blending in Safari 8](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2014/06/09/css-shapes-and-css-compositing-blending-in-safari-8/).
- A look into the future will give you [Custom Media Queries](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries/#custom-mq), which are simply-named aliases for longer and more complex media queries as you know the feature from Sass.

### Go beyond…

- [“Different tools work best for different people”](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/vitaly-friedman/2014-June-9) and “the memory is who you really are. It matters. A lot.”
- [The definite Guide to Freelancing](http://www.thesuperlancer.com/the-definitive-guide-to-freelancing/). I wouldn’t go for ‘definite’ but it’s a great resource with many advices.
- Tesla Motors is stepping forward by [open sourcing all their patents](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you). This is a massive step and of course people wrote also negatively about it but I find this a massive step into the right direction and might eventually help the environment massivel instead of only thinking about earning money.

Thanks and all the best,<br>
