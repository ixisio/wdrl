Hey,<br>
<br>
the first signs of fall are here. I woke up this morning and the city was fully covered in fog. It’s September now and it’s the time of the year when all the confrences happen and the leaves turn red. But I can tell you, there is still summer and when I was in Brighton over the last days to attend the lovely [Reasons To Be Creative festival](http://reasons.to/) we had about 25 degrees and bright sunshine on the beach. Regardless of the weather, the Internet moves on and this is the outcome of the past week:

### News

- Parallels 10 now has the option to install modern.ie virtual machines via one click!
- Firefox Nightly now supports CSS Filters (behind flag `layout.css.filters.enabled`). Color transitions are still a bit jittery but cool to see this. Whilst this, mp4 playback is now enabled by default in Nightly. Oh, and have I mentioned that you now are able to inspect Cookies, local storage, indexed DB and more in DevTools? Cool, isn’t it?

### General

- It seems Markdown will soon be standardized. There is now [an approach of a specification](http://standardmarkdown.com/) which aims to be the reference implementation, specification and documentation for the widely used, simple text based file format, inititally introduced by [John Gruber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber).
- See a [map of digital attacks](http://www.digitalattackmap.com/#anim=1&color=0&country=ALL&time=16317&view=map) running against services at the moment.

### Design

- ”[Is responsive height the new frontier of design?](https://news.layervault.com/stories/32241-is-responsive-height-the-new-frontier-of-design)” It got some interesting [responses](https://news.layervault.com/comments/95645/) on this type of responsiveness.

- Modern.IE team now even [provides Vagrant VMs for their IE](http://blog.syntaxc4.net/post/2014/09/03/windows-boxes-for-vagrant-courtesy-of-modern-ie.aspx) test systems. This is so cool!

### Git

- A bit similar but not the same as `git add -p` (stages only specific lines of your changes which you add interactively) is interactive staging which is useful to stage only specific files of your changes with [`git add -i`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging). Tipps collected by [@drublic](http://drublic.de/) and myself.

### Sass / CSS
