<p>Quite a list this week, right? And this while we have only wednesday means I am one day ahead of schedule. But this is how our industry works: One week we have nearly nothing to talk about and the other week it's super hard to catch up with all the news going around.</p>
<p>Have a nice weekend!<br>
