Hey,<br>
<br>
new week, new articles. Be prepared for a bunch of very interesting blog posts in this weeks reading list.<br>
_If you want to give me some support, I'd be happy if you [vote for me here](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-developer/anselm-hannemann/)._

### News

- In Chrome’s DevTools you now can [go to a line number at a specific column](https://plus.google.com/+UmarHansa/posts/b62VXNnnqN9).
- Significant progress has been achieved on [Pointer Events support in Mozilla and Blink](http://msopentech.com/blog/2014/01/30/pointer-events-progress-mozilla-blink-communities-reach-significant-engineering-milestone/).
- [MilePile is now in public alpha](https://www.mailpile.is/). Nice, but (in my opinion) has way to go.
- [Blink now ships the basic implementation of `srcset`](https://codereview.chromium.org/151233003/) as a base for the to-come `<picture>` element. `srcset` will be shipped in Chrome Canary soon.
- Firefox stable (v27) now has the [CSS property `all: unset` included](http://mcc.id.au/blog/2013/10/all-unset) which basically unsets all default values by the browsers stylesheet.
- [Firefox Nightly supports the HTTP/2 draft](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Networking/http2). It is disabled by default and can only be used over TLS 1.1. This is a major step into the future and I hope other browsers will start adding experimental support, too.

### General useful things

- The Guardian has [an article about DRM worth reading](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management). It bringt very own views on the topic, explains it a bit further and finally connects to mass surveillance which is pretty related.
- Vicki Murley wants to write a new [book about CSS Animations](http://cssanimationbook.com/) funded by a Kickstarter campaign. You can support it now.

### Tools

- [SVGCleaner 0.6](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/SVGCleaner) is [much faster and more accurate](http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/svg-cleaner-0-6).
- [Working when GitHub (or other services) go down](https://help.github.com/articles/sharing-repositories-without-github). A what to do article with workarounds if you rely your work on external git services.
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) looks very good for team communication. Currently it’s in invitation-preview.
- [Pinegrow](http://pinegrow.com/), an visual Webdesign editor to create prototypes.

### Web Performance

- [Optimizing WebFont rendering Performance](http://www.igvita.com/2014/01/31/optimizing-web-font-rendering-performance/).
- [Expectations on HTTP/2](http://www.mnot.net/blog/2014/01/30/http2_expectations) and an explanation how it will work. Good read to get an overview: Cheaper Requests, no more spriting, inlining, same HTTP APIs, network-friendliness, server push and more.
- [Web Performance is User Experience](http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/01/web-performance-is-user-experience.html). Etsy’s performance analyzation lead to the result that adding 160kb to an image leads to 12% mobile bounce rate increase.
- [Above the fold, inlining styles and why this is not always a good idea](https://medium.com/p/f98103d09ce1).

### JavaScript

- [Tether](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) is a javascript library for making an absolutely positioned element stay next to another element. Cool for tooltips.
- Next time if you add an EventListener to `resize`, [consider using a debounce function](http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function) to increase performance.

### CSS

- Hugo Giraudel explains [how Sass Mixins differ from Placeholders and when to use what](http://www.sitepoint.com/sass-mixin-placeholder/).
- He also explains [how Sass `@extend` works](http://www.sitepoint.com/sass-extend-nobody-told-you/) in detail.

### Go beyond…

- We already have the technique for a mobile black-box recorder with us. Our smartphones could save our life. Dan Eden describes in his article [how an Emergency mode on a phone could look like](https://daneden.me/2014/02/04/emergency-mode/).
- Working remote isn’t a bad thing. If you follow some rules, [working remote can be great](http://stet.editorially.com/articles/making-remote-teams-work/) for both, the employees and the employer.

Hope you enjoyed the issue. If you have interesting links for me, [submit them here](http://wdrl.info/submit/) and I'll consider adding them to one of the next issues.

Cheers and have a nice weekend!<br>
