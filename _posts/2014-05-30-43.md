Hey,<br>
<br>
hope you’re all doing fine and had a great week. After last weeks massive input in WebDevLand this week is a bit calmer. But don’t worry, you’ll always get a few articles from me. This week I have IE news, free HipChat, the importance of listening, Fira font, performance budgeting, a better `console.log()` and element queries for you. Have fun reading it!

### News

- [HipChat is now free for normal users and teams](https://blog.hipchat.com/2014/05/27/hipchat-is-now-free-for-unlimited-users/) including one to one chat as well as group chats. To get video chat and unlimited history, it’s still $2/user/month.
- The Internet Explorer team [announced the next version of IE](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/05/27/launching-status-modern-ie-amp-internet-explorer-platform-priorities.aspx), including Web Audio API, Media Capture API, ES6 Promises, HTTP/2, and some other cool features. Along with that, [`status.modern.ie` is now Open Source](https://github.com/InternetExplorer/Status.IE).

### General stuff

- [Sometimes we should rather be silent and listen](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/jeff-eaton/2014-May-27) instead of always sharing our own thoughts which might be wrong anyway. A good read on world-problems, minorities and gender discussions.

### Design

- Fira font, Firefox OS’ typeface, is [now available in version 3.1 and free](http://dev.carrois.com/fira-3-1/) to download.

### Tools

- [A deeper look in automating CSS Sprites](http://blog.booking.com/automating-css-sprites-for-large-organisations.html) for large organisations by the people of Booking.com.

### Git

- [Git 2.0](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1405.3/02592.html) has been announced. For news and changes, just read the linked mail—it covers everything.

### Web Performance

- Tim Kadlec on [Performance Budgeting with Grunt](http://timkadlec.com/2014/05/performance-budgeting-with-grunt/), introducing the tool `grunt-perfbudget` that sets up private WebPerfTest.com instances for your project.
- Many of us talk constantly about web performance but then, on the other hand, they use link shorteners everywhere (okay, mostly on Twitter). have you ever considered [how harmful Link shortners are performance-wise](http://t37.net/why-link-shorteners-harm-your-readers-and-destroy-the-web.html)?

### HTML / SVG

- A brand new slidedeck by Sara Soueidan who held [a great talk about SVG at CSSConf](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Iuvf3saPCJepVJBDNNDSmSsA0_rwtRYehSmmSSLYFVQ/present#slide=id.p) in Florida this week.

### JavaScript

- [Make `console.log()` deliver a better output](http://remysharp.com/2014/05/23/where-is-that-console-log/) with script, line and char number.
- [Promises are easier to understand and read](http://davidwalsh.name/write-javascript-promises).
- [Data Binding Revolutions with `Object.observe()`](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es7/observe/) and `Array.observe()`, coming to ES7 and shipping in Chrome 36 beta.
- [Socket.IO 1.0 is out](http://socket.io/blog/introducing-socket-io-1-0/#) with a new engine, automated testing, better debugging and much more.

### CSS

- Ben Frain asks if [we do wrong using multiple classes for UI components](http://benfrain.com/multiple-classes-ui-component-variations-wrong/). Because what else for do we have `[class=^"btn"]` and other cool selectors?
- Do we need Element Queries? If you think so, [please let us know about your use cases](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/eq-usecases/issues/).
- Writing modular CSS by approaching the [Single Responsibility Principle](http://drewbarontini.com/articles/single-responsibility/).
- [Great effects to introduce your online articles…](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/05/22/inspiration-for-article-intro-effects/)
