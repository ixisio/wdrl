<p>Hey,<br><br>
I'm beginning with an announcement: As I will be in vacation for two weeks I won't send you the Reading List in that time. That means (depending on how much time you have) you have more than two weeks to catch up with the recent issues or have to wait a little bit and have to go outside to enjoy a beer/wine (or whatever you prefer) instead of reading my webdev links.</p>
<p>But let's go to business. I again have a huge list of links for you so you don't get too bored in the next time.</p>
