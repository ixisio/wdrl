Hey,<br>
<br>
while the streets of Cologne are full of people celebrating carnival I wanna give you a quick update on recent developments in our industry:

### News

- **Responsive Images will be implemented in Chrome 34 with `srcset**, `<picture>` to follow soon and Firefox is also getting ready for implementation of both. This is so awesome! I’ve been awaiting this since I opened the whole discussion [back in 2011](http://lists.whatwg.org/htdig.cgi/whatwg-whatwg.org/2011-August/032977.html). After 2.5 years we’re now going to get this feature in our browsers! Thanks to all who are/were involved into the spec-writing and promotion of Responsive Images, you’re all awesome!
- [Imager.js 0.2.0 is out](https://github.com/BBC-News/Imager.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) with IE8 support, alt-attributes, and many improvements on the code.
- GitHub released a invite-only beta of a new code editor called [Atom](https://atom.io/).
- [Bower 1.3](https://github.com/bower/bower/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#master) is to be announced soon and besides many bugfixes, a `bower version` command, scripts and hook support, circular dependencies will now install.

### General useful things

- A solid set of [Git conventions](https://medium.com/code-adventures/a940ee20862d) can help to improve working together in a project a lot.
- Why [refactoring your code constantly](https://medium.com/code-adventures/fc0942419504) should be an important part of your process.

### Design

- A sum-up about [Responive Strategies and methods](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/responsive-strategy/) by Brad Frost.

### Tools

- Twitter open sourced its [RTL style sheet BiDi flipper](https://github.com/twitter/css-flip).

### Web Performance

- Does PageSpeed guide you in the wrong direction when saying to serve CSS from a cookieless domain? Jonathan Klein is [revising the “use cookieless domain”](http://www.jonathanklein.net/2014/02/revisiting-cookieless-domain.html) statement in his article.

### JavaScript

- [Thoughts on debugging JavaScript](http://alliejon.es/blog/2014/02/23/thoughts-on-debugging-javascript/). Because the browser’s DevTools can do so much more than you might think already.

### SVG

- Wohoohooo! This is really an amazing demo showing how you can [“paint” with pure SVG clipping paths and CSS](http://www.pencilscoop.com/demos/animating-svg-clipping-masks/). No JavaScript!

### CSS

- Create an [advanced star rating system with Sass](http://hugogiraudel.com/2014/02/24/star-rating-system-with-sass/) which even can handle half stars.
- An introduction to the new [CSS text property `text-align-last`](http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2014/02/25/improving-your-sites-visual-details-css3-text-align-last/) which solves issues with a justified text block and last-line handling.
- Confused about the CSS values `rem` and `em`? [Understand them now](http://j.eremy.net/confused-about-rem-and-em/).

### Go beyond…
