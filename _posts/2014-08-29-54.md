### News

- Using Firefox Nightly? You now are able to [use `console.table()`](https://twitter.com/gabrielluong/status/504840586944204800/photo/1) and get objects, arrays, maps and sets displayed in a table. Yeah!

### Workflow

- Well, although I’m not sure about the headline, the content of this article is incredibly helpful for our projects. It’s about [Medium’s CSS codebase](https://medium.com/@fat/mediums-css-is-actually-pretty-fucking-good-b8e2a6c78b06) and their earlier failures.

### Go beyond…
