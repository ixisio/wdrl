Hey,<br>
<br>
while the world enjoys the soccer world cup I’m writing this list. To ensure you get all upcoming issues, too, please add `readinglist@helloanselm.com` to your contacts or whitelist the address.

Here’s the list of all the cool articles that fascinate me this week:

### News

- [Chrome 37 ships with an improved offline behavior](http://addyosmani.com/blog/offline-mode-chrome/), displaying you an offline cached version of a website if you re-visit it and will re-load to the lastest online version if you’re back online.
- [PageRes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres/releases/tag/v0.3.0), the screenshot capturing tool by Sindre Sorhus has been version-bumped to 0.3.0, now accepting argument grouping and re-adding `@font-face` support.
- This week Prezi, the amazing interactive online presentation, [upgraded its player to HTML5 finally](https://medium.com/prezi-engineering/how-and-why-prezi-turned-to-javascript-56e0ca57d135).
- [Google Chrome](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/Uxzvrqb6IeU/9FAie9Py4cIJ) will adapt to all other browsers and in near future won’t serve additionally requested sources via scripts in mixed contexts anymore.
- `min-font-size` and `max-font-size` will most probably become a new webstandard, according to the W3C minutes telecon of this week.

### General stuff

- A draft of [all the emoji data we have](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/full-emoji-list.html) in and as unicode characters. It contains previews of the icon on different OS, the name, and which unicode version it belongs to.
- Fantasy is it. Robin Berjon imagined [what the Web could be in 10 years](http://berjon.com/web-2024/). This is an interesting read although highly speculative.

### Design

- Why it is so important for designers to extend their knowledge: Responsive Design is not enough, [you need to think more and more interactively if you develop a web experience](http://paulstamatiou.com/design-provide-meaning-with-motion/) and think about motion, transitions and animations.

### Tools

- grunt-phantomas got an update and now [includes Assertions](http://stefanjudis.github.io/grunt-phantomas/gruntjs/), and more detailed reports.
- You think Assetgraph is just another build tool? Wrong, here’s the authors explanation on it and [how to get started with Assetgraph](http://mntr.dk/2014/getting-started-with-assetgraph/).

### JavaScript

- Now this is an interesting way to [deal easily with media queries in JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/usaphp/42133e78aa5f8f760a3f) without a matchMedia polyfill.


### HTML / SVG

- Sara Soueidan about crafting your own SVG files and what you should know about [Structuring, Grouping, and Referencing in SVG – The `<g>`, `<use>`, `<defs>` and `<symbol>` Elements](http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/structuring-grouping-referencing-in-svg/).
- Chris Coyier tells us why you [opt for `<symbol>` when you create SVG icons](http://css-tricks.com/svg-symbol-good-choice-icons/).

### CSS

- An [origami penguin](http://codepen.io/chrisota/pen/GkFzv) built in CSS.
- A small and easy experiment by Harry Roberts showing how to achieve [equal-width columns in a table](http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/zfSt4/) with `table-layout: fixed;`.
- How to adapt your typography of paragraphs on your site not being a designer. [This screencast](http://www.webdevbreak.com/episodes/responsive-paragraphs) shows you how it works.

### Go beyond…

- [“When one’s expectations are reduced to zero, one really appreciates everything one does have.”](http://www.thechangeblog.com/expectations/)
- [Have you ever lived in a foreign city? In a foreign country?](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/raquel-velez/2014-July-4) Try it, and look at the world through someone else’s eyes. And then make the world better, because then you’ll know how.
- It is important that we get paid for what we do but sometimes [we just should be nice and pay it forward to other people](https://medium.com/@karenmcgrane/pay-it-forward-b5ca623a6b7e)…
- [Do It Yourself](http://bastianallgeier.com/notes/diy).
