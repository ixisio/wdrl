## About WDRL

This project is an attempt to filter and concatenate all the web development links that pop up every single day. The Web Development Reading List aims to filter those links for you so you stay up to date about the latest technologies and techniques but don’t need to read every link you find in the wild.

### The Selection Process

I ([Anselm](http://helloanselm.com/)) collect all the links coming up in my twitter, Google+ stream and my own findings into a rough list. The first selection already happens after I read an article &mdash; if it’s well written and has valuable content it will go into the list, otherwise it will be thrown away. You can imagine there is a load of good articles in just one week; it would be too much for a summary as the WDRL aims to be. A second review guarantees that only important articles and topics come up. Usually this results in about 15 links a week.

### Why?

As you can imagine this is a time consuming job and I gain no money from it. First, it is that I for myself can also filter between important reads and non-important articles. The other thing is, I heard people complaining that there is too much noise and people are completely overstrained by the mass of news in our industry. To provide a solution for those people WDRL has been created.<br>
I’ve once tracked the time I spend every week on the WDRL: Roughly 10hrs.<br>
