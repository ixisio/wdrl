## Sponsor / Advertise in the WDRL

As of September 2014 **I offer two slots for sponsors in the WDRL**:

- 2 slots on the Website (bottom of a letter page, footer)
- 1 slot in the Newsletter (bottom of the letter)

Each slot includes:

- Linked image to your website (max 100kb, static, hosted by WDRL)
- If applicable a short text about you (max. 200chars)

WDRL currently reaches nearly 4000 subscribers via email, a bunch of people via RSS (I do not track this), and between 500 &ndash; 2000 visits online each week.

<a href="mailto:readinglist@helloanselm.com?subject=Sponsoring%20WDRL" class="form__signup--submit">Get in contact via E-Mail</a>

_Note: As you might have recognized I do not state any detailed information about banner size or similar. Instead I want to talk with you how you want to advertise and how much you’re willing to pay for it. And if you have a creative new idea, let me know!_

## Support the WDRL

The Web Development Reading List is curated for you and gives you an overview of the most important links over the week. It helps you to stay up-to-date but it also costs me about 10 hours a week and currently I gain no money out of it except the funds from [Flattr](https://flattr.com/profile/helloanselm) and [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/Anselm%20Hannemann/). Together they’re roughly $20/month which is mostly spend into domain, asset hosting and similar technical things.

So this projects currently lives from the author’s free time. Please consider paying for the service you love
and that helps you gain your own money. Thanks!

In theory I’d love to not show any ads to you and if enough money is coming through the donating channel, I might be able to deactivate them again.
